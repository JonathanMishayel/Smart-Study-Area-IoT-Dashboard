# Smart-Study-Area-IoT-Dashboard
A real-time IoT-based climate monitoring system that collects temperature and humidity data using an ESP32 + DHT22 sensor, transmits it via MQTT, and visualizes it through an interactive Dash + Plotly web dashboard.

This project demonstrates end-to-end integration of IoT hardware, real-time data streaming, and data visualization engineering
